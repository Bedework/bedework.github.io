<h2>What is Bedework?</h2>
<p>
  <em>Bedework</em> is an open-source, enterprise calendaring system.
  <em>Bedework</em>  supports personal, public, and group
  events. It uses existing  open standards, and supports
  web-based and other forms of  access, including <a href="http://ietf.webdav.org/caldav/home.html">CalDAV</a>
  and <a title="http://mis105.mis.udel.edu/ja-sig/uportal/index.html" href="http://mis105.mis.udel.edu/ja-sig/uportal/index.html">
  portal integration</a>. Bedework is built with an emphasis on higher education, though it is used by many commercial enterprises.
</p>
<p>
  The Mission statement for Bedework reads, in part,
  "Bedework  will be a total calendaring and events system for
  institutions  of higher learning. Bedework will be open
  source and platform  independent. It will use existing open
  standards where possible,  especially the standards of the
  <a href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-calendar/index.html">IETF
    Calendaring and Scheduling Working Group</a>. It will
  support integration with other systems and middleware,
  particularly open systems such as <a href="http://mis105.mis.udel.edu/ja-sig/uportal/index.html">
  uPortal</a> and <a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/">Shibboleth</a>.   It
  will be modular, so an institution can deploy only the
  components it needs, and extensible, so an institution can
  build any new component it needs."
