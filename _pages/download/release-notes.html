</ul><h3>Enhancements in Bedework 3.10:</h3>

<ul><li>A largely-revamped public client, which features:
  <ul><li>Responsive design - the public client will display reasonably on almost any screen size.</li>
    <li>More powerful and flexible left-hand navigation - in just a few clicks, site visitors can ask for the "Arts events and Films taking place on West Campus"</li>
    <li>Event filtering by string. – ex., “Arts events and Films on West Campus that include 'Sherlock'".</li>
    <li>An endless stream of events - All events that match the criteria are presented, starting with today's events (or any other date specified), and advancing into the future.   An initial group of events are displayed on the page, and as the visitor scrolls towards the bottom of the page, the next group is presented.</li>
    <li>Improved performance with fewer page reloads - most operations, such as adding or removing a filter, are done "in-page" (using Ajax calls). <br>
       </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Enhancements to indexing
    <ul><li>Bedework 3.10 has a new search engine – ElasticSearch.  In the Bedework context, ElasticSearch, provides better remote management of indexes,   better scalability options, and much simpler configuration than Solr. ElasticSearch is used by, among others,  Wikimedia, Foursquare Etsy, and GitHub.</li>
      <li>Improved performance and scalability by directing most queries to an ElasticSearch index rather than directly to the database engine<br>
         </li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>More real-time site configuration
    <ul><li>All configuration settings are now set through the JMX console, eliminating the need for rebuilds to reconfigure<br>
       </li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>An improved Quickstart
    <ul><li>A smaller (~40%) Quickstart - no-longer-used code (such as webcache) and unused JBoss components have been removed  </li>
      <li>Better Quickstart documentation</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

     </li>
  <li>CalWS-SOAP, a SOAP protocol for calendaring being developed by OASIS and CalConnect. Bedework 3.8 uses CalWS-SOAP for communication between the synchronization engine and Bedework.<br>
     </li>
  <li>WebDAV Synch, which is a draft RFC extension to WebDAV/CalDAV (<a style="color: rgb(37, 123, 178); text-decoration: underline; line-height: 18px; " href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-webdav-sync-06" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-webdav-sync-06</a>), providing a more efficient method for client synchronization. WebDAV synch is currently supported by iCal - the Apple desktop calendaring client, and also by aCal - an Android CalDAV client (<a style="color: rgb(37, 123, 178); text-decoration: underline; line-height: 18px; " href="http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/projects/aCal" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/projects/aCal</a>). <br>

     </li>
  <li>Hypersonic (HSQL) is now packaged with the Quickstart instead of Derby. Derby never met our expectations that it could be deployed as the production DBMS for Bedework, and the advantages of HSQL, including Quickstart support for the Scheduling Assistant,  are compelling.  <br>
     </li>
  <li>Structural changes to projects. <br>
     </li>
  <li>All references to Bedework documentation are updated in the web clients to point to the Bedework website and latest documentation wiki.

<h3 class="release">April 25, 2007 - 3.3.1 release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Access fixes. Note this requires a change to the /public       folder. Previously read + write-content was sufficient for       administrative privileges. Now it must be read +       write-content + bind (may also want unbind to allow       deletions)</li>
  <li>A number of bugfixes to CalDAV support.</li>
  <li>Implemented some missing CalDAV features.
    <ul>
      <li>attachments now work,</li>
      <li>copy/move/rename partially works.</li>
      <li>Freebusy information can be stored</li>
      <li>Tasks (todos)</li>
      <li>Search filters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bug fixes for recurring events</li>
  <li>Timezones shared correctly</li>
  <li>Oracle now builds and deploys without alterations to       generated schema.</li>
  <li>Fixed up restore so that it can handle UWcal 2.3.2       data</li>
  <li>12/24 mode works correctly</li>
  <li>One-shot free and busy url works allow users to publicize       their busy time.</li>
  <li>Scheduling is now close to completion and largely usable.       Some of the more esoteric features still require work, e.g.       instances of recurring meetings, COUNTER is untested.</li>
  <li>UI supports all access control features.</li>
  <li>Import and export of calendars completed</li>
</ul>
<h3>February 23, 2007 - 3.3.1 preview release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CalDAV - Fixes to problems uncovered in the       interoperability testing at CalConnect.</li>
  <li>Recurring events - Fixes to some bugs, especially in the       sharing of these events.</li>
  <li>Timezones - Fixes to problems sharing events with       'private' timezones, such as those added via CalDAV or       imported as ics.</li>
  <li>Access control - Fixed some bugs in setting ACLs. The UI       has been updated to enable all features of access       control.</li>
  <li>Scheduling - Implemented additional functionality.       Scheduling is still incomplete but more features are exposed       in 3.3.1 to allow further testing. We have successfully sent       an invitation, posted a response, and observed the resulting       event in the calendar. Scheduling support is "fragile" but       progressing rapidly.</li>
  <li>Bedework 3.3.1 is much more Oracle-friendly than previous       versions. Based on work done by Julian Ball at Queens, and       Chris Mann at Maryland, we have significantly overhauled the       XML schema, with the intent of eliminating or at least       drastically reducing the modifications Oracle users would       have to make.</li>
