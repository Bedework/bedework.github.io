<p>
  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute licenses the source code of
  Bedework under a "BSD-style" open source license. This license
  permits use of the source code by anyone for any purpose,
  including commercial purposes, requiring only that
  acknowledgment be given. As the package evolves and other
  institutions and individuals contribute to the package, license
  terms for package parts and for the package as a whole will be
  an issue about which the project participants must achieve
  consensus. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is, however,
  committed to preserving these license terms for its
  contributions, and we will work to insure that the BSD-style
  license terms will continue to be used for this package
  indefinitely.

<p>
  Code contributors to Bedework are welcomed but can only be
  accepted from those who have executed our <a href="http://dev.bedework.org/downloads/webcontent/BedeworkLicenseAgrmt.pdf">Contributor
    License Agreement</a>. This document assigns Rensselaer
  Polytechnic Institute a copyright license on your contributions
  to the project. All authors still retain their copyrights. This
  agreement serves at least two purposes. First, it provides
  clear proof that the contributions can be distributed as part
  of the Bedework project. Second, should someone decide to take
  some sort of legal action against the project, Rensselaer
  Polytechnic Institute could step forward immediately as the
  party defending Bedework, instead of having to track down all
  the authors.
