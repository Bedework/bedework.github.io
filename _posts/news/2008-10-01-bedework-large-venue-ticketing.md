## Summary

<p>A ticketing system for opening events of Rensselaer’s Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center was developed using 
Bedework as the central component. The system allows users to register, request tickets, and build an event agenda. 
Super‐users can download event registrations, update tickets for any user on any event, and place tickets on hold. 
Event data is exported for outboard reporting, analyses and ticket printing. This approach exploits the calendar as 
the application platform ‐ all event information is stored in Bedework, and incorporated into the registration system,
the EMPAC Opening website, and a calendaring site for mobile (handheld) devices.</p>
