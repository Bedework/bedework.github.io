<p>Today, March 27, 2007, is Bedework’s birthday, or less
  anthropomorphically, the one year anniversary of the first
  production instance of Bedework 3.0. In many respects,
  certainly from the perspective we had in June 2003 when we
  first joined the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/ucal/">UWCalendar</a>
  development team, it is hard for us to believe that we find
  ourselves in this position. It seems appropriate to reflect on
  this first year of the Bedework project and share some
  observations and thoughts.</p>
<p>In September 2005, we announced, “For some time we have
  discussed the possibility of beginning work in earnest on a new
  Hibernate-based version of UWCalendar. RPI was planning another
  to work towards a 2.4 distribution to incorporate minor bug
  fixes and the like related to personal calendar support.
  However, we have unexpectedly (to us, anyhow) changed course
  and have been exclusively working on Version 3.0, named
  BedeWork.”</p>
<p>Our rationale listed “<a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>” more than once
  as one of the main drivers for creating Bedework rather than
  continuing development of UWCalendar. As for the name “<a href="/about/bede">Bedework</a>”, we wanted a
  name not derived from a specific institution, such as RPI, and
  something that was easy (enough) to pronounce and to remember
  as a URL. Additionally all word play, clever and otherwise, on
  "cal" was already taken.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Bedework 3.1</strong> included personal calendars,
  calendar sharing, free/busy display, restructuring into
  multiple SVN projects, and the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt?number=4791">CalDAV</a>
  server was restructured to allow use as a proxy.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bedework 3.2</strong> provided improved <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168">JSR168</a> support,
  more SVN Restructuring, CalDAV improvements and calendar
  suites.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bedework 3.3</strong> added <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> searching,
  migration to <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index_jdk5.jsp">Java
  1.5</a> and <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi">Tomcat
  5.5</a>, the reappearance of categories, improved CalDAV
  support, significant progress supporting <a href="http://openconnector.org/">OpenConnector</a>, support
  for recipients and attendees, iCal import and export of
  multiple events / whole calendars, improved timezone displays /
  support, support for floating time values, support for storing
  UTC time values, recurring event support, human readable text
  fields now stored with language information to facilitate
  internationalization, scheduling (meeting requests, replies
  etc) mostly implemented, significant improvements to the web
  user interfaces, XHTML user clients &amp; <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> based widgets , bug
  fixes (e.g. access control) and housekeeping (e.g. all tables
  given consistent names)</p>
<p>
  <strong>Bedework 3.3.1</strong>, soon to be released, has
  (yet again) CalDAV bug fixes, recurring events bug fixes,
  especially in the sharing of these events, timezones bug fixes
  to sharing events with 'private' timezones, such as those added
  via CalDAV or imported as ics., access control bug fixes.
  Having just reread the 3.3.1 list, we now feel very comfortable
  with 3.3.1 as a minor “bug fix” release. Additionally, the UI
  was updated for all features of access control. And thanks to
  help from <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/homepage/">Queens University</a>
  and the <a href="http://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland</a>, 3.3.1
  is much more Oracle-friendly, drastically reducing the
  modifications required for Oracle.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we (and Bedework) participated in <a href="http://www.calconnect.org/">CalConnect</a>
  interoperability testing events, along with other calendar
  vendors such as Apple and Oracle. We participated in the
  crafting of the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt?number=4791">CalDAV
    specification</a> which was just published as <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4791.txt?number=4791">RFC
    4791</a>.<span>&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>We have gotten deeply involved, much more deeply, in
  <em>Bedework</em> than we anticipated when we started
  collaborating with Washington more than four years ago.
  However, our overall focus remains delivering value locally (to
  the RPI community) while at the same time making
  <em>Bedework</em> attractive enough to other universities that
  they would adopt the software and contribute to its
  development.</p>
<p>“Bedework” met most of our objectives for a name, save one –
  many people do not <a href="/about/bede">pronounce</a> it as you would
  “beadwork”. Instead, Bedework is very much like the band in the
  movie “That thing You Do”, the “Oneders” (the “Wonders”), which
  most people mispronounced as the “O’needers (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Thing_You_Do%21#Story">
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Thing_You_Do!#Story</a>).</p>
<p>The decision to use Hibernate has been validated, although
  achieving DBMS independence has proven a little more difficult
  than we anticipated.</p>
<p>We now refer to Bedework as “a calendar system for higher
  education” rather than as an “institutional calendar”, so it no
  longer sounds like it is a product for correctional facilities.
  Bedework is not intended to be only for higher ed (and isn’t),
  but higher ed is our target audience. (Higher ed considerations
  for Bedework include support for public events calendaring, low
  "buy-in" cost - integrates with extant campus directories and
  extant campus authentication, no license or usage fees, works
  with a number of DBMSes, supports distributed administration,
  is easily "skinnable", is JSR-168 (portal) "friendly", is used
  and developed by multiple universities, available under an <a href="/download/license">Open Source license</a>, and
  we assume Bedework will be one of many different calendaring
  systems on campus.)</p>
<p>
  <a href="/news/bedework-receives-mellon-foundation-matc-award">The Mellon Award for
    Technology Collaboration</a> was a gratifying validation of the
  Bedework project, perhaps more important than the financial
  part of the award.</p>
<p>Bedework has been <a href="/about/deployments">adopted by a number of
  organizations</a> and is in deployment or under consideration
  at a number of others, which is, again, very gratifying.</p>
<p>Like Forest Gump who found himself a shrimp boat captain, we
  find ourselves leaders of an open source project. It happens.
  However, unlike Forest Gump, we are not savants of any kind,
  and our open source leadership has been mixed. We have
  incorporated contributions from some of you, and from others we
  have contributions which we have not yet incorporated,
  something we need to address. In Scott Rosenberg’s “<a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/">Dreaming in Code</a>”,
  Rosenberg says of Eric Raymond’s “The Cathedral and the
  Bazaar“, Raymond identified two key prerequisites… and the rise
  of a cooperative ethos built around a leadership style like
  Torvald’s that encouraged newcomers, welcomed contributions,
  and strove to maximize the number of qualified participants.”
  Whereas Linux has a place in the open source pantheon that
  Bedework will never assume, the ideal of the “cooperative
  ethos” described above seems to be worth striving for. As noted
  previously, we have much to learn in this regard.</p>
<p>One of the best things about the Bedework project is that it
  has allowed us to meet many of you and to work with some of
  you. We have enjoyed the collaboration and comradeship very
  much and it has been very edifying in many ways.</p>
<p>
  <a href="/about/standards">Standards compliance</a> is
  the key to Bedework’s success - present and future.</p>
<p>Calendaring is surprisingly hard, at least interoperable,
  standards-compliant calendaring.</p>
<h2>Bedework Futures</h2>
<p>Some of the improvements and changes on our radar for
  Bedework include change notification via email, an external
  event submission mechanism , more complete recurrence
  implementation, complete implementation of scheduling, Ajax
  features in the clients, various features from RFC 2445 -
  todos, attachments, multi-language support, better support for
  Microsoft SQLServer, improved packaging and installation,
  improved Outlook/Exchange interoperability, improved JSR168
  support and integration, and tuning and optimization.</p>
<p>One of our plans for the financial part of the Mellon award
  was to hire RPI students to work with us on Bedework
  development. This has taken longer than we anticipated (which
  seems to be a recurring theme), but we now have some new
  applicants and this is looking more promising.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>We are grateful to the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>
  for allowing us to cut our calendaring teeth with them. And, we
  are grateful to those of you who have selected Bedework as your
  calendaring system and for those of you who have contributed to
  Bedework development.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make Bedework the leading open source
  Java-based calendar in higher ed, which can only happen if we
  continue to grow the Bedework user community, and we continue
  to grow the Bedework contributor community. The “we” in this
  case is not the “royal we” but the “communal
  we”. For those of you who would like help
  deploying Bedework or developing new features or functionality,
  we would be happy to talk with you about joining us at RPI for
  a few days to work together. For those of you with thoughts
  about how to make Bedework a better calendaring system or a
  better open source project, please take the time to <a href="/contact">share them with us</a>.
  Reflecting on Bedework at “1” has been a pleasure but
  reflecting on Bedework at “5” or “10” would be a privilege.</p>
