<p>Bedework version 4.2.0 is now available. Installation instructions can be found  at <a href="https://bedework.github.io/bedework/#featurepack-install">https://bedework.github.io/bedework/#featurepack-install</a></p>

<p>Release notes are at <a href="http://bedework.github.io/bedework/#release-notes">http://bedework.github.io/bedework/#release-notes</a></p>

<p>This release has, once again, been a long time coming. Again there have been many internal changes.  
</p>
<p>
As always there are a bunch of bug fixes, many in handling of recurring events (again).
</p>
<p>
We are still running on jdk 17 and wildfly 26. The move past the jakarta boundary has to be th main focus - made easier now that some  of the main dependencies have also made the move.
