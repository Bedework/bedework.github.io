<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/in-potential-blow-to-open-source-software-mellon-foundation-closes-grant-program/19519">
    We learned yesterday</a>
    that the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has merged the Research
    in Technology (RIT) with the Scholarly Communications program
    and that Ira Fuchs and Chris Mackie, Vice President and
    Associate Program Officer respectively, are no longer with
    Mellon. It is not yet clear what exactly the termination of the
    RIT program will mean as stewardship of RIT-funded projects
    moves to Mellonâ€™s Scholarly Communications program.</p>
    
<p>Although Bedework was not a Mellon funded project, 
  <a href="/news/bedework-receives-mellon-foundation-matc-award">Bedework was among the 10
  initial recipients</a> of The <a href="http://rit.mellon.org/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's
  Technology Collaboration (MATC) Award</a> in December 2006.
  Chris Mackie strongly encouraged and influenced our work, and
  visited with us at RPI twice, most recently two months ago.</p>
    
<p>The RIT program made a very important contribution to the
  worlds of open source and higher education, both financially
  and intellectually. (See <a href="http://rit.mellon.org/projects">http://rit.mellon.org/projects</a>
  for a list of many of the projects funded by RIT).</p>
    
<p>In his presentations, Chris said that, to his knowledge,
  Research in Information Technology was the largest
  non-governmental, NFP funder of OSS infrastructure projects in
    the world. Whereas almost everyone follows the money, RIT
    provided much more than money. Chris connected OSS projects
    with other OSS projects, and introduced them to other ideas,
    methodologies, and philosophies. Chris served an information
    broker for software development in Higher Education.</p>
  
<p>We consider Chris Mackie and Ira Fuchs valued friends of
    Bedework, and we wish them success in whatever comes next for
    them, and we look forward to working with them again in a new
    context in the future.</p>
