Mike Douglass, Bedework's chief architect, and Steven Lees of Microsoft <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4176.html">discuss XML iCalendar on Jon Udell's show</a>.

## Abstract

<p>"There's a new effort to define an XML representation for iCalendar, 
the venerable standard for exchanging calendar information. In this episode of
Interviews with Innovators, host Jon Udell talks with two of the authors of the 
proposed specification -- Mike Douglass and Steven Lees -- about why it's 
needed, what kinds of problems it will and won't solve, and how the 
capabilities that iCalendar enables compare and contrast with those 
enabled by the newer CalDAV standard."</p>
