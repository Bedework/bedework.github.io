<strong>San Diego, CA March 8, 2010</strong> Jasig, the
    non-profit consortium responsible for sponsoring open source
    higher education technology projects, and Rensselaer
    Polytechnic Institute (RPI) announced that Bedework, the
    enterprise calendar system, has become a fully sponsored Jasig
    project, having progressed successfully through the Jasig
    Incubator.</p>
<p>Bedework is the leading open source enterprise calendar
    built by and for the higher education community. Bedework will
    continue to evolve through contributions from a global
    community and will be sustained by support from academic
    institutions, commercial affiliates, and non-profit
    foundations. An initial Bedework Steering Committee has been
    formed with developer, stakeholder, and Jasig board
    representation from Rensselaer, Brown, Duke, Yale, Universidad
    Publica de Navarra, and the University of California at
    Berkeley.</p>
<p>Gary Schwartz, Bedework Project Manager at RPI, sought to
    align Bedework with a larger community about a year ago. Jasig
    seemed like a natural fit. "Jasig sponsorship for Bedework will
    allow us to meet the requirement that we set forth almost six
    years ago to make a lasting contribution to open source and
    higher education", said Schwartz. "RPI sees the stability of a
    larger community, Jasig's affiliation with commercial service
    providers, and the consortiums collaborations with other open
    source projects as factors that will contribute to Bedework's
    sustainability."</p>
<p>Institutions currently deploying Bedework Calendar have been
    very responsive to the move. "Individuals at Duke University
    have been pleased to learn that Bedework is becoming a fully
    sponsored Jasig project," said Deborah Johnson, Assistant Vice
    Provost of Administrative and Community Support Services. "This
    assures us that the Bedework calendar software we use for our
    Events@Duke calendar will not only receive ongoing support, but
    will also benefit from a coordinated and more widespread
    development effort."</p>
<p>The University of California at Berkeley is currently
    contributing to further Bedework development in the area of
    personal calendaring. "Berkeley is excited to have the
    opportunity to be engaged with the Bedework project", said
    Michael R. Mundrane, Deputy Chief Information Officer for the
    University of California at Berkeley. "We looked at a number of
    options before choosing and it was readily apparent that this
    was a capable product led by an experienced and receptive RPI
    team. We have every expectation that this standards centric
    platform will be the key to delivering a high value service to
    our community."</p>
<p>The Bedework team is in the process of converting the
    Bedework infrastructuremailing lists, code repository and
    licensing, wiki, issue tracking, etc.to Jasig hosted servers.
    This migration effort will be completed in time for Bedework
    3.7, the next major release.</p>
